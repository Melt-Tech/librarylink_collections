# The Library.Link Network - Shared Collections 

This repository provides an open collection of Lists and Mixes which can be used in any Library that is part of [The Library.Link Network](http://library.link).
  
## How to view these Collections

Library.Link Collections can be defined in 2 different ways. 

1) [Lists](https://github.com/zepheira/librarylink_collections/tree/master/lists). 
Lists are fixed, ordered set of library items that have been organized for a particular purpose. Any List can be used by any Library in The Library.Link Network.

2) [Mixes](https://github.com/zepheira/librarylink_collections/tree/master/mixes). 
Mixes are more dynamic and blend library items that share concepts (including more specialized persons,topics, forms, places, etc.) together to create new collections. Any Mix can be used by any Library in The Library.Link Network.
